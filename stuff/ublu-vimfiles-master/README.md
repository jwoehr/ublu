# Ublu Vim syntax files

Some simple syntax files to improve quality of life working with Jack Woehr's [Ublu](https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu) software and scripting language.

# Install

```sh
make install
```

Do not run the installation as root.  It will install into ~/.vim.  If you don't have a ~/.vim (like you are on windows), use VIMHOME to point to your home vim install:

```sh
make VIMHOME=/vimfiles install
```

# Uninstall

```sh
make uninstall
```
